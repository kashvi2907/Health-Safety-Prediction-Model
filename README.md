# Health-Safety-prediction-model
#### This project uses Python to build a machine learning model that predicts potential future workplace incidents based on historical incident data. This project was done during my Data Analytics Internship with the Health & Safety Department in Danone. I first translated the textual data fields to english, followed by feature engineering and training the model, and lastly exporting my predictions to Power BI to build an interactive dashboard. As the data used for building the model is confidential company data, I am unable to provide the original raw data. 

#### This repository shows the development of the first model, which predicts some information about past incidents so that it can be compared against the true information about past incidents. This was done to determine the accuracy of the model's predictions before developing the second model, which solely predicts future incidents. As shown in the Data preprocessing and feature engineering file, the fields that were predicted for past incidents are: Types of Injuries and Kinds of Hazards.
